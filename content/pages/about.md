I don't write too much - a) it was already said elsewhere,
b) I have nothing to say, c) it takes too much time
to write something meaningful (like
[this post](/2016/10/31/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance/)
for example). It doesn't mean that I don't write at all, just the
frequency is low.
